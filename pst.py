File:     pst.py (Port Send Time)

Purpose:  Set the time on the arduino board
          for use with the Time library found
          at http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/time

Usage:    % python pst.py

Effect:   Send message like "T1359713903" over the serial port
          That is the time string for Fri Feb  1 10:18:23 EST 2013

Config:   Set the variable "time_zone_offset" for the offset to GMT.  The
          value -5 works for US Eastern Standard Time

          Set the variable port to the usb port used by your Arduino
          board.  In Arduino IDE, go to Tools > Serial Port and note
          which port is checked.
